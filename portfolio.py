Yes! Let's create a **clear agent interaction graph** for your LLM financial advisor scenario and explain **where the loop happens (if any)**.

## 🧩 Agent Roles Recap

| Agent            | Role                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent 1          | Portfolio Planner (creates allocation)            |
| Agent 2          | ETF & Stock Selector (fills in specific tickers)  |
| Agent 3          | Risk & Optimization Reviewer (audits portfolio)   |
| Optional Agent 4 | Performance Forecaster (simulates future returns) |

## 🔁 Interaction Graph

Here’s the full interaction flow:

### 🌀 Loop Explanation

* **The loop is between Agent 2 and Agent 3**:

  * If Agent 3 finds the portfolio too risky or not diversified, it asks for modifications.
  * Agent 2 refines the selection based on Agent 3’s feedback.
  * This can repeat **until Agent 3 gives the green light**.

---

## 🔂 Loop Exit Criteria

Agent 3 exits the loop when:

* Diversification is adequate.
* No major asset class is overexposed.
* Portfolio risk aligns with user profile.

## 🧠 How to Implement the Loop?

If using **LangGraph**, you can model this as:

* A state machine where:

  * `Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3`
  * `Agent 3` has a **conditional edge**:

    * If `status == "ok"`, go to `final_output`.
    * If `status == "adjust"`, return to `Agent 2`.

If you're interested, I can help you write the LangGraph code structure with condition handling using tags or transitions.
