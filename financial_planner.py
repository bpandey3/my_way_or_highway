## üîÑ Agent Loop Setup

You can structure this using:

* **CrewAI** (if you prefer workflow-style execution with role-based agents)
* **Manual Python orchestration** with a context-sharing object

---

Would you like me to give you a working **LangGraph example code template** or a **Streamlit demo setup** for this?
